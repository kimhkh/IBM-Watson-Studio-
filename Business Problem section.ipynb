Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Italian restaurant in Futain, China.\n\nSince there are lots of restaurants in Futain we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nWe will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen. ",
